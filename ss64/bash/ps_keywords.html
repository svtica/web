<p> Here are the different keywords that may be used to control the
output format (e.g., with option -o) or to sort the selected<br>
processes with the GNU-style --sort option.<br>
<br>
For example: <span class="code">ps -eo pid,user,args --sort user</span><br>
<br>
This version of ps tries to recognize most of the keywords used in
other implementations of ps.<br>
<br>
The following user-defined format specifiers may contain spaces:<br>
<span class="code">args, cmd, comm, command, fname, ucmd, ucomm, lstart, bsdstart,
start.</span><br>

Some keywords may not be available for sorting.<br>

       CODE        HEADER    DESCRIPTION

       %cpu        %CPU      cpu utilization of the process in "##.#"
                             format.  Currently, it is the CPU time used
                             divided by the time the process has been
                             running (cputime/realtime ratio), expressed as
                             a percentage.  It will not add up to 100%
                             unless you are lucky.  (alias pcpu).

       %mem        %MEM      ratio of the process's resident set size  to
                             the physical memory on the machine, expressed
                             as a percentage.  (alias pmem).

       args        COMMAND   command with all its arguments as a string.
                             Modifications to the arguments may be shown.
                             The output in this column may contain spaces.
                             A process marked <defunct> is partly dead,
                             waiting to be fully destroyed by its parent.
                             Sometimes the process args will be unavailable;
                             when this happens, ps will instead print the
                             executable name in brackets.  (alias cmd,
                             command).  See also the comm format keyword,
                             the -f option, and the c option.
                             When specified last, this column will extend to
                             the edge of the display.  If ps can not
                             determine display width, as when output is
                             redirected (piped) into a file or another
                             command, the output width is undefined (it may
                             be 80, unlimited, determined by the TERM
                             variable, and so on).  The COLUMNS environment
                             variable or --cols option may be used to
                             exactly determine the width in this case.  The
                             w or -w option may be also be used to adjust
                             width.

       blocked     BLOCKED   mask of the blocked signals, see signal(7).
                             According to the width of the field, a 32 or
                             64-bit mask in hexadecimal format is displayed.
                             (alias sig_block, sigmask).

       bsdstart    START     time the command started.  If the process was
                             started less than 24 hours ago, the output
                             format is " HH:MM", else it is " Mmm:SS" (where
                             Mmm is the three letters of the month).  See
                             also lstart, start, start_time, and stime.

       bsdtime     TIME      accumulated cpu time, user + system.  The
                             display format is usually "MMM:SS", but can be
                             shifted to the right if the process used more
                             than 999 minutes of cpu time.

       c           C         processor utilization.  Currently, this is the
                             integer value of the percent usage over the
                             lifetime of the process.  (see %cpu).

                             According to the width of the field, a 32 or 64
                             bits mask in hexadecimal format is displayed.

                             shown.  A process marked <defunct> is partly
