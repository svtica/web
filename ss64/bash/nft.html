<p>Administration tool of the nftables framework for Network Address Translation (NAT), packet filtering and classification.<br>
Set up, maintain and inspect packet filtering and classification rules in the Linux kernel, in the nftables framework.</p>
<pre>Syntax
      nft [<B> -</B>nNscae<B> </B>] [ -I <I>directory</I>] [ -f <I>filename</I> | -i | <I>cmd</I>...]
      nft -h 
      nft -v 

Key
   -n, --numeric    Show data numerically. When used once (the default behaviour), skip lookup of addresses to symbolic names.
                    Use twice to also show Internet services (port numbers) numerically. Use three times to also show protocols and UIDs/GIDs numerically.
   -N, --reversedns Translate IP addresses to names. Usually requires network traffic for DNS lookup.
   -s, --stateless  Omit stateful information of rules and stateful objects.
   -c, --check      Check commands validity without actually applying the changes.
   -a, --handle     Show object handles in output.
   -e, --echo       When inserting items into the ruleset using <B>add</B>, <B>insert</B> or <B>replace</B> commands,
                    print notifications just like <B>nft monitor</B>.
   -I, --includepath </B><I>directory</I>
                    Add the directory <I>directory</I> to the list of directories to be searched for included files.
                    This option may be specified multiple times.
   -f, --file </B><I>filename</I>  Read input from <I>filename</I>. If <I>filename</I> is -, read from stdin. nft scripts must start <B>#!/usr/sbin/nft -f</B>
   -i, --interactive    Read input from an interactive readline CLI.
                        You can use <B>quit</B> to exit, or use the EOF marker, normally this is CTRL-D.
   -h, --help       Show help message and all options.
   -v, --version    Show version.</pre>
<p>The Linux kernel subsystem is known as <span class="code">nf_tables</span>, and 'nf' stands for Netfilter.</p>
<p> nftables provides several advantages over iptables: the simplification of the Linux kernel ABI, reduction of code duplication, improved error reporting, and more efficient execution, storage and incremental changes of filtering rules. Traditionally used iptables(8), ip6tables(8), arptables(8) and ebtables(8) (for IPv4, IPv6, ARP and Ethernet bridging, respectively) are intended to be replaced with nft(8) as a single unified implementation, providing firewall configuration on top of the in-kernel virtual machine. </p>

<blockquote>
<H3>LEXICAL CONVENTIONS</H3>
<p>Input is parsed line-wise. When the last character of a line, just before the newline character, is a non-quoted backslash (\), the next line is treated as a continuation. Multiple commands on the same line can be separated using a semicolon (;).</p>
<p>A hash sign (#) begins a comment. All following characters on the same line are ignored.</p>
<p>Identifiers begin with an alphabetic character (a-z,A-Z), followed zero or more alphanumeric characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9) and the characters slash (/), backslash (\), underscore (_) and dot (.). Identifiers using different characters or clashing with a keyword need to be enclosed in
double quotes (&quot;).</p>
<H3>INCLUDE FILES</H3>
<p><span class="code"><B>include</B> <I>filename</I></span></p>
<p>Other files can be included by using the <B>include</B> statement.
The directories to be searched for include files can be specified using
the <B>-I/--includepath</B> option. You can override this behaviour
either by prepending ./ to your path to force inclusion of files located in the
current working directory (ie. relative path) or / for file location expressed
as an absolute path.</p>
<p>If -I/--includepath is not specified, then nft relies on the default directory
that is specified at compile time. You can retrieve this default directory via
-h/--help option.
</p>
<p>

Include statements support the usual shell wildcard symbols
(*,?,[]). Having no matches for an include statement is not
an error, if wildcard symbols are used in the include statement. This allows having
potentially empty include directories for statements like
include &quot;/etc/firewall/rules/*&quot;. The wildcard matches are
loaded in alphabetical order. Files beginning with dot (.) are
not matched by include statements.
</p>
<H3>SYMBOLIC VARIABLES</H3>
<p class="code"><B>define</B> 


variable <I>expr</I>






<B>$variable</B> 





</p>
<p>

Symbolic variables can be defined using the <B>define</B> statement.
Variable references are expressions and can be used initialize other variables.
The scope of a definition is the current block and all blocks contained within.

export [<B>ruleset</B>] <I>format</I> </p>
<p>The <B>ruleset</B> keyword is used to identify the whole set of tables, chains, etc. currently in place in kernel. The following <B>ruleset</B> commands exist:
</p>
<pre>list   Print the ruleset in human-readable format.
flush  Clear the whole ruleset. Note that unlike iptables, this will remove all tables and whatever they contain,
       effectively leading to an empty ruleset - no packet filtering will happen anymore, so the kernel accepts
       any valid packet it receives.
export Print the ruleset in machine readable format.
       The mandatory <I>format</I> parameter may be either xml or json. </pre>

<p>

It is possible to limit <B>list</B> and
<B>flush</B> to a specific address family only. For a
list of valid family names, see ADDRESS FAMILIES above.
</p>
<p>Example, store the configuration in json format:<br>

<p>Tables are containers for chains, sets and stateful objects. They are identified by their address family and their name. The address family must be one of ip, ip6, inet, arp, bridge, netdev.
The inet address family is a dummy family which is used to create hybrid IPv4/IPv6 tables. The meta expression nfproto keyword can be used to test which family (ipv4 or ipv6) context the packet is being processed in.
When no address family is specified, ip is used by default. The only difference between <B>add</B> and <B>create</B> is that the former will not return an error if the specified table already exists while <B>create</B> will return an error.

Chains are containers for rules. They exist in two kinds,
base chains and regular chains. A base chain is an entry point for
packets from the networking stack, a regular chain may be used
as jump target and is used for better rule organization.

</TABLE>
<p>Apart from the special cases illustrated above (e.g. nat type not supporting forward hook or route type only supporting output hook), there are two further quirks worth noticing:</p>
<dl>
<dt>&bull;
netdev family supports merely a single
combination, namely filter type and
ingress hook. Base chains in this family also require the device parameter to be present since they exist per incoming interface only.</dt>
<dt>&bull;
arp family supports only
input and output
hooks, both in chains of type
filter.</dt>
</dl>
<p>The priority parameter accepts a signed integer value which specifies the order in which chains with same hook value are traversed. The ordering is ascending, i.e. lower priority values have precedence over higher ones.</p>
<p>Base chains also allow to set the chain's policy, i.e. what happens to packets not explicitly accepted or refused in contained rules. Supported policy values are accept (which is the default) or drop.

<p>nftables offers two kinds of set concepts.
Anonymous sets are sets that have no specific name. The set members are enclosed in curly braces, with commas to separate elements when creating the rule the set is used in.
Once that rule is removed, the set is removed as well.</p>
<p>They cannot be updated, i.e. once an anoymous set is declared it cannot be changed anymore except by removing/altering the rule that uses the anonymous set.</p>

<p>Flowtables allow you to accelerate packet forwarding in software.
Flowtables entries are represented through a tuple that is composed of the
input interface, source and destination address, source and destination
port; and layer 3/4 protocols. </p>
<p>Each entry also caches the destination
interface and the gateway address - to update the destination link-layer
address - to forward packets. The ttl and hoplimit fields are also
decremented. Hence, flowtables provides an alternative path that allow
packets to bypass the classic forwarding path. </p>
<p>Flowtables reside in the
ingress hook, that is located before the prerouting hook. You can select
what flows you want to offload through the flow offload
expression from the forward chain. Flowtables are
identified by their address family and their name. </p>
<p>The address family
must be one of
ip, ip6, inet.
The inet address family is a dummy family which is used to create
hybrid IPv4/IPv6 tables.
When no address family is specified, ip is used by default. </p>

<p>
 Expressions represent values, either constants like network addresses, port numbers etc. or data
gathered from the packet during ruleset evaluation. Expressions can be combined using binary,
logical, relational and other types of expressions to form complex or relational (match) expressions.
They are also used as arguments to certain types of operations, like NAT, packet marking etc.

Each expression has a data type, which determines the size, parsing and representation of
symbolic values and type compatibility with other expressions.

<H2><a id="data-types"></a>DATA TYPES</H2>
<blockquote>
<p>Data types determine the size, parsing and representation of symbolic values and type compatibility
of expressions. A number of global data types exist, in addition some expression types define further
data types specific to the expression type. Most data types have a fixed size, some however may have
a dynamic size, f.i. the string type.
</p>

<P>

Types may be derived from lower order types, f.i. the IPv4 address type is derived from the integer
type, meaning an IPv4 address can also be specified as an integer value.
<P>

In certain contexts (set and map definitions) it is necessary to explicitly specify a data type.
Each type has a name which is used for this.

<p>
 The lowest order expression is a primary expression, representing either a constant or a single
datum from a packet's payload, meta data or a stateful module. 
</p>

<H3>META EXPRESSIONS</H3>




<span class="code"><B>meta</B> 
{length | nfproto | l4proto | protocol | priority}

[meta] {mark | iif | iifname | iiftype | oif | oifname | oiftype | skuid | skgid | nftrace | rtclassid | ibriport | obriport | pkttype | cpu | iifgroup | oifgroup | cgroup | random | secpath}</span>
<P>

A meta expression refers to meta data associated with a packet.
<P>

There are two types of meta expressions: unqualified and qualified meta expressions.
Qualified meta expressions require the <B>meta</B> keyword before the
meta key, unqualified meta expressions can be specified by using the meta key directly
or as qualified meta expressions.
Meta l4proto is useful to match a particular transport protocol that is part of either
an IPv4 or IPv6 packet. It will also skip any IPv6 extension headers present in an IPv6 packet.

<span class="code"><B>@</B> 


[<I>base,offset,length</I>]</span>
<P>
The raw payload expression instructs to load <I>length</I>bits starting at <I>offset</I>bits.
Bit 0 refers the the very first bit -- in the C programming language, this corresponds to the topmost bit, i.e. 0x80 in case of an octet.
They are useful to match headers that do not have a human-readable template expression yet.
Note that nft will not add dependencies for Raw payload expressions.
If you e.g. want to match protocol fields of a transport header with protocol number 5, you need to manually
exclude packets that have a different transport header, for instance my using meta l4proto 5 before
the raw expression.

<H3>CONNTRACK EXPRESSIONS</H3>

Conntrack expressions refer to meta data of the connection tracking entry associated with a packet.
<P>

There are three types of conntrack expressions. Some conntrack expressions require the flow
direction before the conntrack key, others must be used directly because they are direction agnostic.
The <B>packets</B>, <B>bytes</B> and <B>avgpkt</B> keywords can be
used with or without a direction. If the direction is omitted, the sum of the original and the reply
direction is returned. The same is true for the <B>zone</B>, if a direction is given, the zone
is only matched if the zone id is tied to the given direction.

</blockquote>
<H2><a id="statements"></a>STATEMENTS</H2>
<blockquote>
<p>
 Statements represent actions to be performed. They can alter control flow (return, jump
to a different chain, accept or drop the packet) or can perform actions, such as logging,
rejecting a packet, etc.
</p>
<p>

Statements exist in two kinds. Terminal statements unconditionally terminate evaluation
of the current rule, non-terminal statements either only conditionally or never terminate
evaluation of the current rule, in other words, they are passive from the ruleset evaluation
perspective. There can be an arbitrary amount of non-terminal statements in a rule, but
only a single terminal statement as the final statement.
</p>

<H3>VERDICT STATEMENT</H3>

The verdict statement alters control flow in the ruleset and issues
policy decisions for packets.
<P class="code">




{accept | drop | queue | continue | return}





{jump | goto} <I>chain</I>


<DL COMPACT>
<DT><B>accept</B><DD>
Terminate ruleset evaluation and accept the packet.
<DT><B>drop</B><DD>
Terminate ruleset evaluation and drop the packet.
<DT><B>queue</B><DD>
Terminate ruleset evaluation and queue the packet to userspace.
<DT><B>continue</B><DD>
Continue ruleset evaluation with the next rule. FIXME
<DT><B>return</B><DD>
Return from the current chain and continue evaluation at the
next rule in the last chain. If issued in a base chain, it is
equivalent to <B>accept</B>.
<DT><B>jump </B><I>chain</I><DD>
Continue evaluation at the first rule in <I>chain</I>.
The current position in the ruleset is pushed to a call stack and evaluation
will continue there when the new chain is entirely evaluated of a
<B>return</B> verdict is issued.
<DT><B>goto </B><I>chain</I><DD>
Similar to <B>jump</B>, but the current position is not pushed
to the call stack, meaning that after the new chain evaluation will continue
at the last chain instead of the one containing the goto statement.

<H3>PAYLOAD STATEMENT</H3>

It can be used for example to set ip DSCP (differv) header field or ipv6 flow labels.
<P>

</p>
<P>

The log statement enables logging of matching packets. When this statement is used from a rule, the Linux kernel will print some information on all matching packets, such as header fields, via the kernel log (where it can be read with dmesg(1) or read in the syslog). If the group number is specified, the Linux kernel will pass the packet to nfnetlink_log which will multicast the packet through a netlink socket to the specified multicast group. One or more userspace processes may subscribe to the group to receive the packets, see libnetfilter_queue documentation for details. This is a non-terminating statement, so the rule evaluation continues after the packet is logged.

A reject statement is used to send back an error packet in response to the matched packet otherwise it is equivalent to drop so it is a terminating statement, ending rule traversal. This statement is only valid in the input, forward and output chains, and user-defined chains which are only called from those chains.

The nat statements are only valid from nat chain types.
<P>

The <B>snat</B> and <B>masquerade</B> statements specify that the source address of the packet should be modified. While <B>snat</B> is only valid in the postrouting and input chains, <B>masquerade</B> makes sense only in postrouting. 
<P>The <B>dnat</B> and <B>redirect</B> statements are only valid in the prerouting and output chains, they specify that the destination address of the packet should be modified. You can use non-base chains which are called from base chains of nat chain type too. All future packets in this connection will also be mangled, and rules should cease being examined.
<P>

The <B>masquerade</B> statement is a special form of <B>snat</B> which always uses the outgoing interface's IP address to translate to. It is particularly useful on gateways with dynamic (public) IP addresses.
<P>

The <B>redirect</B> statement is a special form of <B>dnat</B> which always translates the destination address to the local host's one. It comes in handy if one only wants to alter the destination port of incoming traffic on different interfaces.
<P>

Note that all nat statements require both prerouting and postrouting base chains to be present since otherwise packets on the return path won't be seen by netfilter and therefore no reverse translation will take place.

<H3>FLOW OFFLOAD STATEMENT</H3>

A flow offload statement allows us to select what flows
you want to accelerate forwarding through layer 3 network
stack bypass. You have to specify the flowtable name where
you want to offload this flow.
<P>

<H3>QUEUE STATEMENT</H3>

This statement passes the packet to userspace using the nfnetlink_queue handler. The packet is put into the queue identified by its 16-bit queue number. Userspace can inspect and modify the packet if desired. Userspace must then drop or reinject the packet into the kernel. See libnetfilter_queue documentation for details.

</PRE>
<H3>FWD STATEMENT</H3>

The fwd statement is used to redirect a raw packet to another interface. Its is only available in the netdev family ingress hook.
It is similar to the dup statement except that no copy is made.
<P>




<span class="code"><B>fwd</B>

<I>device</I></span>
<H3>SET STATEMENT</H3>

The set statement is used to dynamically add or update elements in a set from the packet path.
The set setname must already exist in the given table.
Furhermore, any set that will be dynamically updated from the nftables ruleset must specify
both a maximum set size (to prevent memory exhaustion) and a timeout (so that number of entries in
set will not grow indefinitely).
The set statement can be used to e.g. create dynamic blocklists.
<P class="code">{add | update} <I><b>@setname</b></I> { <I>expression </I>[timeout <I>timeout</I>] [comment <I>string</I>] } </p>
<P><B>Example for simple blocklist</B>
<PRE>
    # declare a set, bound to table &quot;filter&quot;, in family &quot;ip&quot;.  Timeout and size are mandatory because we will add elements from packet path.
    nft add set ip filter <b>myblocklist</b> &quot;{ type ipv4_addr; flags timeout; size 65536; }&quot;

    # safelist internal interface.
    nft add rule ip filter input meta iifname &quot;internal&quot; accept

    # drop packets coming from blocked ip addresses.
    nft add rule ip filter input ip saddr <b>@myblocklist</b> counter drop

    # add source ip addresses to the backlist if more than 10 tcp connection requests occured per second and ip address.
    # entries will timeout after one minute, after which they might be re-added if limit condition persists.
    nft add rule ip filter input tcp flags syn tcp dport ssh meter flood { ip saddr timeout 10s limit rate over 10/second} add <b>@myblocklist</b> { ip saddr timeout 1m } drop

    # inspect state of the rate limit meter:
    nft list meter ip filter flood

    # inspect content of blocklist:
    nft list set ip filter <b>myblocklist</b>

    # manually add two addresses to the set:
    nft add element filter <b>myblocklist</b> { 10.2.3.4, 10.23.1.42 }</PRE>

<p>
 These are some additional commands included in nft.
</p>

<H3>MONITOR</H3>

The monitor command allows you to listen to Netlink events produced
by the nf_tables subsystem, related to creation and deletion of objects.
When they occur, nft will print to stdout the monitored events in either
XML, JSON or native nft format.
<P>

To filter events related to a concrete object, use one of the keywords <span class="code">'tables</span>', '<span class="code">chains</span>', '<span class="code">sets</span>', '<span class="code">rules</span>', '<span class="code">elements</span>', '<span class="code">ruleset</span>'.
<P>

To filter events related to a concrete action, use keyword <span class="code">'new'</span> or <span class="code">'destroy'</span>.
<P>

Hit ^C to finish the monitor operation.
<P>

Listen to all events, report in native nft format:<PRE>
% nft monitor           
</PRE>

<P>

Listen to added tables, report in XML format:<PRE>
% nft monitor new tables xml

<H2><a id="error-reporting"></a>Error Reporting</H2><blockquote>
<p>When an error is detected, nft shows the line(s) containing the error, the position of the erroneous parts in the input stream and marks up the erroneous parts using
carrets (^). If the error results from the combination of two expressions or statements, the part imposing the constraints which are violated is marked using tildes (~).
</p>

<P>For errors returned by the kernel, nft can't detect which parts of the input caused the error and the entire command is marked.</P>
