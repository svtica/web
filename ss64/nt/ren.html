<p>Rename a file or files.</p>
<pre>   REN [<i>drive</i>:][<i>path</i>]<i>SourceMask TargetMask</i></pre>
<p> Both the <i>SourceMask</i> and <i>TargetMask</i> can contain<span class="code"> * </span>and/or<span class="code"> ? </span><a href="syntax-wildcards.html">wildcards</a>. <br>
As described below, the behavior of these wildcards is slightly different for a <i>source</i> or a <i>target</i> mask.</p>
<p>REN can also be used to rename directories, but this behaviour is undocumented. <br>
A simple <span class="code">REN folderA folderB</span> will work, but wildcard operations are <b>not</b> supported for directories, if you issue a wildcard rename that matches both files and directories, the file(s) will be renamed and the folders will be ignored. 
If you issue a wildcard rename that matches only directories then a syntax error will be thrown.</p>
<p>You cannot specify a different drive or path for <i>TargetMask</i> - use the <a href="move.html">MOVE</a> command instead.</p>
<p>RENAME is a synonym for REN</p>
<h2>Rename files within subdirectories</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>By default REN with a wildcard will only rename the files in a single folder, to recurse down into sub folders use a <a href="for_r.html">FOR /R</a> command, after first changing to the top level directory.</p>
<p> e.g. A batch file to rename all .LOG files to .TXT in the 'C:\demo\' folder and all sub-folders:</p>
<p><span class="code"> CD C:\demo\<br>
For /R %%G in (*.LOG) do <b>Echo</b> REN &quot;%%G&quot; &quot;%%<a href="syntax-args.html">~dpn</a>G.TXT&quot;</span><br>
Remove the <b>echo</b> to run this for real <br>
</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>SourceMask</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The sourceMask works as a filter to determine which files are  renamed. The wildcards work here the same as with any other command that  filters file names.</p>
  <blockquote>
<p><span class="code">? </span> Matches any 0 or 1 character except .  This wildcard is greedy - it always consumes the next character if it is not a .  However it will match nothing without failure if at name end or if the next character is a .</p>
<p><span class="code">* </span> Matches any 0 or more characters including .  (with one exception below).  This wildcard is not greedy. It will match  as little or as much as is needed to enable subsequent characters to  match.</p>
</blockquote>
  <p>All non-wildcard characters must match themselves, with a few special case exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="code">. </span>Matches itself or it can match  the end of name (nothing) if no more characters remain. (Note - a valid  Windows name cannot end with .)</p>
<p><span class="code">{space}</span> Matches itself or it can  match the end of name (nothing) if no more characters remain. (Note - a  valid Windows name cannot end with {space})</p>
<p><span class="code">*.</span> at the end, Matches any 0 or more characters except <span class="code">.</span> The terminating <span class="code">.</span> can actually be any combination of <span class="code">.</span> and <span class="code">{space}</span> as long as the very last character in the mask is <span class="code">.</span> this is the one and only exception where<span class="code"> * </span>does not  match <i>any </i>set of characters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The above rules are not that complex. But there is one more very  important rule that makes the situation confusing: The <i>SourceMask</i> is  compared against both the long name and the short 8.3 name (if it  exists). This last rule can make interpretation of the results very  tricky, because it is not always obvious when the mask is matching via  the short name.</p>
<p>It is possible to use <a href="fsutil.html">FSUTIL</a> to disable the generation of short 8.3  names on NTFS volumes, at which point interpretation of file mask  results is much more straight forward. Any short names that were  generated before disabling short names will remain. New installations of Windows server now default to disabling 8.3 names.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>TargetMask</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The <i>TargetMask</i> specifies the new name. It is always applied to the  full long name; The <i>TargetMask</i> is never applied to the short 8.3 name,  even if the <i>SourceMask</i> matched the short 8.3 name.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of wildcards in the <i>SourceMask</i> has no impact on how wildcards are processed in the <i>TargetMask</i>.</p>
<p>In the following discussion<span class="code"> c </span>represents any character that is not <span class="code">*</span>,<span class="code"> ?</span>, or<span class="code"> .</span></p>
<p>The <i>TargetMask</i> is processed against the source name strictly from left to right with no back-tracking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><span class="code">c </span>Advances the position within the source name as long as the next character is not . and appends c to the target name. (Replaces the character that was in source with c, but never replaces .)</p>
<p><span class="code">? </span>Matches the next character from the source long name and appends it to the target name as long as the next character is not .  If the next character is <span class="code">.</span> or if at the end of the source name then no character is added to the  result and the current position within the source name is unchanged.</p>
<p><span class="code">* </span>At end of sourceMask - Appends  all remaining characters from source to the target. If already at the  end of source, then does nothing.</p>
<p><span class="code">*c </span> Matches all source characters from current position through the last occurance of c (case sensitive greedy match) and appends the matched set of characters to the target name. If c is not found, then all remaining characters from source are appended, followed by c  This is the only situation I am aware of where Windows file pattern matching is case sensitive.</p>
<p><span class="code">*. </span> Matches all source characters from current position through the last occurance of . (greedy match) and appends the matched set of characters to the target name. If . is not found, then all remaining characters from source are appended, followed by .</p>
<p><span class="code">*? </span>Appends all remaining characters from source to the target. Any additional characters after the *? in sourceMask will be appended to target. If already at end of source then does nothing.</p>
<p><span class="code">. </span>without<span class="code"> * </span>in front - Advances the position in source through the first occurance of <span class="code">.</span> without copying any characters, and appends <span class="code">.</span> to the target name. 
  If <span class="code">.</span> is not found in the source, then advances to the end of source and appends <span class="code">.</span> to the target name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the <i>TargetMask</i> has been exhausted, any trailing . and {space} are trimmed off the end of the resulting target name because Windows file names cannot end with . or {space}</p>
<p><i>It appears these same rules also work for the target name of the COPY commmand.</i></p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8.3 Filename bug - a single command can rename the same file twice!</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>When 8.3 filenames exist then the <i>SourceMask</i> will first look for a match against the long file name, and then against the short file name. If the result of the first rename operation still matches the <i>SourceMask</i> then the same file can be renamed twice. For example:</p>
<pre>copy nul 123456789.123
dir /x
ren *1* <b>2*3.?x</b>
dir /x</pre>
<p>Expected result = 223456789.123.x<br>
Actual result = 223456789.123.<b>xx</b></p>
<p>If <a href="syntax-filenames.html">8.3 name generation</a> is enabled, the <i>SourceMask</i>  matches the original long name, the initial rename  generates a short name that still matches <i>SourceMask</i> and sorts later in the alphabet, then this bug <i>might</i> be triggered.<br>
</p>
<p>If 8.3 name generation is disabled then RENAME always gives the expected result.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Errorlevels</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>If the File(s) were successfully  renamed <span class="code"><a href="errorlevel.html">%ERRORLEVEL%</a> = 0</span><br>
If the File was not found, could not be renamed or bad parameters <span class="code"><a href="errorlevel.html">%ERRORLEVEL%</a> = 1</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Examples</b></p>
<p>Rename Monday.txt as Tuesday.txt<br>
<span class="code">C:\&gt; REN Monday.txt Tuesday.txt </span></p>
<p>Substitute a character in the 1st and 3rd positions prior to any extension (adds a 2nd or 3rd character if it doesn't exist yet)</p>
<pre>ren  *  A?Z*
  1        -&gt; AZ
  12       -&gt; A2Z
  1.txt    -&gt; AZ.txt
  12.txt   -&gt; A2Z.txt
  123      -&gt; A2Z
  123.txt  -&gt; A2Z.txt
  1234     -&gt; A2Z4
  1234.txt -&gt; A2Z4.txt</pre>
<p>Change the (final) extension of every file</p>
<pre>ren  *  *.txt
  a     -&gt; a.txt
  b.dat -&gt; b.txt
  c.x.y -&gt; c.x.txt</pre>
<p>Append an extension to every file</p>
<pre>ren  *  *?.bak
  a     -&gt; a.bak
  b.dat -&gt; b.dat.bak
  c.x.y -&gt; c.x.y.bak</pre>
<p>Remove any extra extension after the initial extension. Note that adequate<span class="code"> ? </span>must be used to preserve the full existing name and initial extension.</p>
<pre>ren  *  ?????.?????
  a     -&gt; a
  a.b   -&gt; a.b
  a.b.c -&gt; a.b
  part1.part2.part3    -&gt; part1.part2
  123456.123456.123456 -&gt; 12345.12345   (note truncated name and extension because not enough `?` were used)</pre>
<p>Same as above, but filter out files with initial name and/or  extension longer than 5 chars so that they are not truncated. (Obviously  could add an additional<span class="code"> ? </span>on either end of targetMask to preserve names and extensions up to 6 chars long.)</p>
<pre>ren  ?????.?????.*  ?????.?????
  a      -&gt;  a
  a.b    -&gt;  a.b
  a.b.c  -&gt;  a.b
  part1.part2.part3  -&gt;  part1.part2
  123456.123456.123456  (Not renamed because it doesn't match sourceMask)</pre>
<p>Change characters after last <span class="code">_</span> in name and attempt to preserve extension. (Doesn't work properly if <span class="code">_</span> appears in extension.)</p>
<pre>ren  *_*  *_NEW.*
  abcd_12345.txt  -&gt;  abcd_NEW.txt
  abc_newt_1.dat  -&gt;  abc_newt_NEW.txt
  abcdef.jpg          (Not renamed because it doesn't match sourceMask)
  abcd_123.a_b    -&gt;  abcd_123.a_NEW  (not desired, but no simple RENAME form will work in this case) </pre>
<p>Any name can be broken up into components that are delimited by <span class="code">.</span> characters can only be appended to or deleted from the end of each  component. Characters cannot be deleted from or added to the beginning  or middle of a component while preserving the remainder with wildcards.  Substitutions are allowed anywhere.</p>
<pre>ren  ??????.??????.??????  ?x.????999.*rForTheCourse
  part1.part2            -&gt;  px.part999.rForTheCourse
  part1.part2.part3      -&gt;  px.part999.parForTheCourse
  part1.part2.part3.part4   (Not renamed because it doesn't match sourceMask)
  a.b.c                  -&gt;  ax.b999.crForTheCourse
  a.b.CarPart3BEER       -&gt;  ax.b999.CarParForTheCourse
</pre>
<p>A sourceMask with at least 8<span class="code"> ? </span>for the name and at least 3<span class="code"> ? </span>for the extension will match all files because it will always match the short 8.3 name.</p>
<pre>ren ????????.???  ?x.????999.*rForTheCourse
  part1.part2.part3.part4  -&gt;  px.part999.part3.parForTheCourse</pre>
